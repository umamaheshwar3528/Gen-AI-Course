Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n\nThis codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files.\n\n**Note**: We recommend doing this codelab first today.

Here's a breakdown to help you understand the differences:\n\n**Trim Levels:**\n\n* **LE (Luxury Edition):** This was the base model. It came with a 3.8L V6 engine and a decent level of standard features, but it didn't have the bells and whistles of the higher trims.\n* **SE (Special Edition):**  This trim added some extra features, like a more luxurious interior, and possibly different wheel designs, but it still retained the 3.8L V6 engine.\n* **LSE (Luxury Special Edition):** Similar to the SE, but with even more luxurious features and appointments. It could come with different interior choices and possibly a slightly more powerful engine option.\n* **SSE (Super Sport Edition):** This trim was geared towards performance. It came with a more powerful 3.8L V6 engine that produced more horsepower and torque, sportier suspension tuning, and some cosmetic differences like a rear spoiler.\n* **SSEi (Super Sport Edition, Injection):** The \"i\" stands for injection, meaning it featured a fuel-injected 3.8L V6 engine that was even more powerful than the standard SSE. It also received a slight visual upgrade to differentiate it from the regular SSE.\n\n**Book Value:**\n\nIt's difficult to give you a precise book value without knowing the specific condition, mileage, and options of the 1989 Bonneville you're interested in. However, you can use resources like:\n\n* **Kelley Blue Book (KBB):** [https://www.kbb.com/](https://www.kbb.com/)  - This is one of the most well-known resources for determining car values.\n* **Edmunds:** [https://www.edmunds.com/](https://www.edmunds.com/) - Another popular site for vehicle values.\n* **NADA Guides:** [https://www.nadaguides.com/](https://www.nadaguides.com/) -  This site focuses specifically on used car values.\n\nWhen you input the specifics of the car, these websites will give you an estimated trade-in value, private party value, and retail value. \n\n**Negotiating Price:**\n\n* **Typical Discount:** You can usually expect to negotiate a price that is lower than the book value. The exact amount will depend on several factors, including the car's condition, demand in your area, and the seller's motivation.\n* **Best Time to Buy:**  You're correct that mid-spring to early summer is generally considered a good time to buy a car. This is because dealerships are often trying to clear inventory before the new model year arrives.\n\n**Things to Remember:**\n\n* **Condition:** The condition of the car plays a huge role in its value. Make sure to have the car inspected by a mechanic before purchasing to ensure it's in good shape.\n* **Mileage:**  Higher mileage cars typically have lower value.\n* **Options:** Cars with more desirable options and features tend to hold their value better.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* **Reliability:** 1988-1989 Bonnevilles are generally known for being reliable, but there are common problems you should be aware of. Research online forums and owner reviews to learn more. \n* **Parts Availability:** Parts for these cars are still readily available, although some specialty items might be harder to find.\n* **Community:** There are online forums and clubs dedicated to Buick Bonneville enthusiasts, which can be great resources for information and support.\n\nI hope this information helps you find the perfect 1989 Bonneville!

Let's break it down for you:\n\n**1988-1989 Bonneville Models:**\n\n* **Bonneville:** The base model, offering decent features and a comfortable ride.\n* **Bonneville LE (Luxury Edition):**  This trim added more luxurious touches like leather seats, power options, and upgraded sound systems.\n* **Bonneville SE (Special Edition):** This trim focused on sporty performance. It might have a slightly more powerful engine, different suspension tuning, or sportier aesthetics.\n* **Bonneville LSE (Luxury Special Edition):** This combined the features of the LE and SE, offering a blend of luxury and performance.\n* **Bonneville SSE (Sport Sedan Edition):**  The SSE was the top-of-the-line model with even more powerful engines, sportier handling, and premium interior features.\n* **Bonneville SSEi (Sport Sedan Edition with Injection):**  This variant of the SSE featured fuel injection for improved performance and fuel economy.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\nThe main differences between these trims boiled down to:\n\n* **Engine:** The SSE and SSEi had the most powerful engines.\n* **Styling:** Sportier trims (SE, SSE) had more aggressive bodywork, wheels, and sometimes spoilers.\n* **Interior:**  Luxury trims (LE, LSE) had premium materials, power seats, and upgraded audio systems.\n* **Features:** Power windows, locks, and mirrors were common across the lineup, but higher trims might have added amenities like cruise control, air conditioning, and sunroof.\n\n**Book Value and Demand:**\n\nUnfortunately, it's hard to provide an exact book value for a 1989 Bonneville without knowing the specific trim level, mileage, condition, and location. You can use resources like Kelley Blue Book (KBB), Edmunds, or NADA Guides to get an estimate.\n\n**Here's what to keep in mind about demand and pricing:**\n\n* **Seasonality:**  You are correct; spring and early summer are often good times to negotiate car prices.\n* **Condition:**  A well-maintained, low-mileage Bonneville will command a higher price. \n* **Demand:**  The demand for classic Bonnevilles, especially those in good condition, is relatively steady.  \n\n**Important Tips:**\n\n* **Research:** Before you buy, thoroughly research the specific model you're interested in. Read reviews, check online forums, and talk to owners. \n* **Inspection:**  Have a qualified mechanic inspect any Bonneville you consider purchasing.\n* **Negotiate:**  Use online resources and your research to be informed when negotiating the price.\n\nGood luck with your Bonneville search! \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This technique still produces quite a verbose response.
